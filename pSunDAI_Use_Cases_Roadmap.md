# ☀️ pSunDAI Ecosystem: Use Cases & Roadmap
### The Autonomous Stable Asset on PulseChain

---

## 🧠 Overview

pSunDAI is an **autonomous, over-collateralized stable asset** minted directly on the PulseChain network.  
It represents a new category in decentralized finance — the **Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA)** — built on immutable code, with no admin keys, governance, or discretionary control.

Unlike fiat-backed or algorithmic stablecoins, pSunDAI’s value is guaranteed by **on-chain PLS collateral**, enforced by immutable smart-contract math.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Users deposit PLS** into the PegVault contract.  
2. The vault allows them to **mint up to 66%** of that collateral’s USD value in pSunDAI (150% collateral ratio).  
3. If the collateral value drops below 110%, **anyone can liquidate** the vault to restore solvency.  
4. All collateral, debt, and ratios are publicly auditable on-chain.

This creates a **trustless, decentralized credit system** anchored to PLS, the native asset of PulseChain.

## 💡 Core Use Cases

### 1. Native Stable Asset for PulseChain
- Enables on-chain pricing, lending, and trading in a stable unit.  
- Acts as a *non-custodial alternative* to fiat-backed stables like USDC or PYUSD.  
- Fully auditable — no banking intermediaries or custodians.

---

### 2. Unlock PLS Liquidity Without Selling
- Users can **borrow against their PLS** while retaining upside exposure.  
- No repayment schedule — positions are self-managed and can remain open indefinitely.  
- Useful for long-term holders who prefer to stay “never selling.”

---

### 3. Foundation for DeFi Building Blocks
- pSunDAI can serve as collateral, quote currency, or unit of account for PulseChain-native dApps.  
- Future lending, NFT, or yield protocols can integrate pSunDAI as a stable component.

---

### 4. Transparent, Immutable Monetary Layer
- Every minted token is verifiably backed by PLS at ≥150% collateral ratio.  
- No oracle manipulation possible beyond observable on-chain prices.  
- Code-enforced risk, not governance-enforced discretion.

## 🌞 The SunDAI Connection — “The Meme That Becomes Money”

SunDAI ($SUNDAI) is the cultural counterpart to pSunDAI’s financial layer.  
It begins as a **meme token** with narrative energy and evolves into a contributor to the **Destiny Vault**, which converts SunDAI + LP assets into **PLS collateral** for the PegVault.

This creates a **closed, self-bootstrapping loop**:
