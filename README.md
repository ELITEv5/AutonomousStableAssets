## Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA) — Definition  
An ASA is a crypto-collateralized, immutable smart contract system designed to maintain stability through over-collateralization and autonomous liquidation logic.  
It operates without issuers, governance, or fiat reserves — representing a new class of on-chain monetary asset.
