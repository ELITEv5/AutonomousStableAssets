# 🪙 GHO vs pSunDAI  
### Governance-Backed vs Autonomous Stable Assets  
*By Elite Team 6, 2025*

---

## 🧠 Overview

While both **GHO** and **pSunDAI** aim to create stable, collateral-backed assets in DeFi,  
their architectures, governance models, and economic foundations differ radically.  

| Concept | **Aave GHO** | **pSunDAI (ASA)** |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Category** | Governance-Backed Stablecoin | Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA) |
| **Issuer** | Aave DAO (Governance-controlled) | Immutable Smart Contract |
| **Core Purpose** | Provide a native stablecoin within Aave’s lending ecosystem | Create a self-governing, overcollateralized stable asset for PulseChain |
| **Collateral Type** | Multiple (ETH, wstETH, etc.) | PLS (native token only) |
| **Collateral Custody** | Shared liquidity pools | Isolated per-vault ownership |
| **Borrowing Model** | Interest-bearing loan | Zero-interest mint |
| **Interest Rate** | Dynamic (set by governance) | 0% (immutable) |
| **Governance** | DAO-controlled parameters | No governance, no admin keys |
| **Oracles** | Chainlink (centralized feeds) | Dual on-chain TWAP oracle |
| **Upgradeability** | Upgradable via DAO | Permanently immutable |
| **Fee Capture** | Sent to Aave DAO treasury | None (no fee token) |
| **Collateral Ratio** | Minimum 110% | Minimum 150% |
| **Peg Mechanism** | Governance-managed arbitrage | Algorithmic liquidation equilibrium |
| **Failure Mode** | Governance attack or oracle failure | Oracle staleness only |
| **Legal Risk** | Likely MSB-classified (governed issuance) | Pure software (no issuer entity) |

## ⚙️ How GHO Works

1. Users deposit collateral into Aave.
2. Aave DAO parameters determine how much GHO can be minted.
3. GHO is minted as a *loan* and accrues a small interest fee.
4. Peg is maintained through arbitrage and governance decisions.
5. DAO receives a portion of the revenue via AAVE token staking.

GHO operates like a **central bank within Aave** —  
it relies on human governance, voting, and protocol management to adjust its economics.

## ⚖️ How pSunDAI Works

1. Users deposit **PLS** into immutable vaults.
2. They mint **pSunDAI** directly from collateral (no pool, no DAO).
3. Peg is maintained by liquidation math — if collateral falls below 150%, others can liquidate for reward.
4. No interest, no revenue, no governance — just code.

pSunDAI operates like **a self-contained digital economy** —  
it is immutable, mathematical, and permanently permissionless.

## 🧩 Core Philosophical Difference

| Aspect | **GHO** | **pSunDAI** |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Who controls the money?** | Aave DAO (human voting) | The code (no human control) |
| **Peg enforcement** | Governance + arbitrage | Liquidation math |
| **Flexibility** | Adjustable by vote | Immutable by design |
| **Trust Model** | Social consensus | Algorithmic determinism |
| **Purpose** | Lending market utility | Monetary base layer stability |

> “GHO is programmable policy.  
> pSunDAI is programmable physics.”

## 🔐 Governance & Control

**GHO**
- Controlled by Aave DAO votes.
- DAO can change rates, pause minting, or modify collateral lists.
- Requires trust in oracle feeds and governance security.

**pSunDAI**
- No DAO, no upgrades, no keys.
- Immutable rules ensure predictable behavior forever.
- Collateral, oracles, and ratios are hard-coded.

---

## 💡 Economic Philosophy

- **GHO** is an *Aave product* — a managed stablecoin that captures protocol value.  
- **pSunDAI** is a *monetary experiment* — an autonomous equilibrium between math and market behavior.

| Feature | GHO | pSunDAI |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Interest | ✅ Yes | ❌ None |
| Fees | ✅ To DAO | ❌ None |
| Revenue | ✅ AAVE holders | ❌ None |
| Supply Adjustments | ✅ Governance | ❌ Market-only |

## ⚖️ Summary

| Category | GHO | pSunDAI |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Economic Layer** | Market Layer | Monetary Layer |
| **Nature** | Governed stablecoin | Autonomous stable asset |
| **Dependence** | Requires Aave DAO | Requires only the chain |
| **Censorship Resistance** | Partial | Absolute |
| **Stability Method** | Governance policy | Mathematical liquidation |
| **Ideal Use Case** | Internal lending currency | Base layer collateral for DeFi |

### 🧠 Final Thought

**GHO** seeks to manage stability through policy and incentives.  
**pSunDAI** achieves it through physics and immutable code.  

Both aim for a stable dollar —  
but only one can survive without governance, interest, or intervention.
