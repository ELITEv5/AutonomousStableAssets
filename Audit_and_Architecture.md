# 🧬 pSunDAI ASA — Autonomous Stable Asset System  
**Audit & Architecture Documentation**  
by **Elite Team6**

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **pSunDAI ASA System** is an immutable, autonomous, and self-healing stable asset suite deployed on **PulseChain**.  
It defines a new DeFi primitive — the **Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA)** — that operates entirely without admin keys, governance, or external dependencies.

Every component is fully deterministic, immutable, and mathematically verifiable on-chain.

## 🧩 System Components

| Contract | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **`pSunDAIV8`** | Stable Asset | ERC20 token (pSunDAI) minted/burned exclusively by the vault. Immutable, vault-linked. |
| **`pSunDAIoraclePLSX`** | Oracle Layer | Triple-source TWAP oracle aggregating WPLS/DAI₁, WPLS/DAI₂, and WPLS/USDC pairs via PulseX. Median-filtered, self-healing, and permissionless. |
| **`pSunDAIVaultASA`** | Autonomous Vault | Core protocol logic for minting, collateralization, and liquidations. Fully self-regulating with embedded invariants and no external control. |

## ⚙️ System Flow

### 1. **Collateral Deposit**
Users deposit **PLS** or **WPLS** into the vault.

```solidity
depositPLS() → wraps PLS into WPLS → records collateral
depositAndAutoMint() → deposits PLS + auto-mints pSunDAI at 155% CR
All deposits are tied to the user's personal vault — no shared pools, no rehypothecation.

2. Oracle Aggregation
The oracle continuously maintains three time-weighted average prices (TWAPs):

Pair 1: WPLS / DAI (main)

Pair 2: WPLS / DAI (alternate)

Pair 3: WPLS / USDC (stabilizer)

The oracle:

Validates liquidity depth (MIN_RESERVE_USD = 50,000)

Enforces 30-minute TWAP intervals

Discards stale or divergent data (>3% deviation)

Returns the median price for safety

Result → a manipulation-resistant fair market price for WPLS in USD terms.

3. Minting Logic
Vault checks collateralization before minting:

solidity
Copy code
col * price * 100 >= debt * COLLATERAL_RATIO * 1e18
If safe, it mints pSunDAI directly to the user via the immutable token contract:

solidity
Copy code
psundai.mint(msg.sender, amount);
4. Repayment & Withdrawals
Users can:

Repay debt (repay())

Withdraw collateral safely (withdraw() or withdrawPLS())

Use one-step rebalancing:

solidity
Copy code
repayAndWithdraw()
→ burns pSunDAI and auto-withdraws excess collateral, maintaining 150% CR.

5. Emergency & Fail-Safes
If all oracle feeds fail (no updates for >24h), vault enters “emergency mode.”
Users can manually withdraw their full collateral after the delay, ensuring zero loss of funds.

solidity
Copy code
emergencyWithdraw()
🔐 Security Design
Feature	Protection Mechanism
Oracle Safety	Triple-source TWAP with 3% deviation clamp and liquidity minimum
Stale Data Prevention	Rejects data > 120s old
Immutable Deployment	No upgradeability, no owner, no modifiers
Vault Isolation	Each vault isolated by mapping(address => Vault)
Reentrancy Guard	All state mutating functions use OpenZeppelin nonReentrant
Collateral Cooldowns	30m delay before re-withdrawal; prevents flash-deposits
Oracle Fail Delay	24-hour enforced wait before emergency mode
Auto-Healing Logic	Oracle can recover itself via prime() or updatePublic() without admin intervention

Flow Summary

Vault validates oracle price feed.

Vault ensures collateral ratio safety.

Vault mints or burns pSunDAI accordingly.

Oracle continuously updates via PulseX TWAPs.

System operates autonomously forever.

📊 Parameter Summary
Parameter	Value	Description
COLLATERAL_RATIO	150%	Minimum CR required to mint
LIQUIDATION_RATIO	110%	Threshold for liquidation
WITHDRAW_COOLDOWN	30 min	Prevents abuse of flash deposits
ORACLE_FAIL_DELAY	24 hr	Delay before emergency mode
MIN_ACTION_AMOUNT	0.1 PLS	Minimum interaction amount
MAX_DEVIATION_BPS	300 (3%)	Oracle pair deviation clamp
MIN_TWAP_INTERVAL	1800 sec	Required TWAP sample duration

🧮 Math Audit Summary
All math operations use OpenZeppelin’s Math.mulDiv for precision and overflow safety.

✅ No unchecked arithmetic except where provably safe.
✅ All division denominators validated nonzero.
✅ No rounding errors that compromise CR or safety checks.
✅ Scaling consistent at 1e18 precision.
