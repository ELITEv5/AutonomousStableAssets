# ⚖️ Legal Framework & Compliance Overview  
**Project:** pSunDAI – Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA)  

---

## 🧩 Overview
pSunDAI is an **autonomous, over-collateralized digital asset** built on immutable smart contracts.  
It is *not* a fiat-backed or centrally issued stablecoin.  
All minting and redemption logic occur entirely on-chain without governance, admin keys, or intermediaries.

This document outlines the protocol’s legal position relative to proposed and existing stablecoin regulations (e.g., the U.S. **Genius Act**).

---

## 🔐 1. No Issuer or Custodian
- The contracts are **immutable** and have **no upgrade or ownership keys**.  
- Every pSunDAI token is minted only when a user deposits sufficient PLS collateral into a vault.  
- There is **no company or foundation** holding reserves or guaranteeing redemptions.

**Result:**  
There is no “issuer” as defined under stablecoin or e-money regulations.

---

## 💰 2. Over-Collateralized, Not Fiat-Backed
Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins (USDC, PYUSD, etc.), pSunDAI:
- Does not represent a claim on any bank deposits.  
- Is not redeemable for USD or other fiat currencies.  
- Derives its value purely from the market value of locked PLS collateral.

**Classification:**  
Crypto-collateralized commodity-type asset, not a fiat-backed instrument.

---

## 🧮 3. Price Stability Mechanism
pSunDAI maintains value through:
- Over-collateralized vaults (150% minimum ratio).  
- Autonomous liquidation incentives.  
- On-chain oracle-based pricing.

There are **no discretionary monetary policies** or algorithmic pegs.  
Value equilibrium is achieved through market arbitrage.

---

## 💻 4. Front-End UI Service
Any hosted interface may charge a **transparent service fee** (e.g., 0.25%) to cover hosting and maintenance.

Guidelines:
- UI remains **non-custodial** (users sign their own transactions).  
- Fees are disclosed clearly (“Front-end service fee applied”).  
- No representations of 1 USD redemption or guaranteed returns.  

**Legal framing:** operating a software interface, not a financial product.

## 🧾 5. Regulatory Mapping

| Jurisdiction | Primary Law / Rule | Relevance to pSunDAI |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **United States** | Genius Act (2024 draft) – governs fiat-redeemable stablecoins | pSunDAI is crypto-collateralized, not fiat-redeemable → *outside scope* |
| **European Union** | MiCA – “E-money Tokens” require issuer control | No issuer or redemption right → *not applicable* |
| **United Kingdom** | FCA Stable Token regime (custodial issuers) | Non-custodial protocol → *exempt* |
| **APAC / Others** | Similar issuer-based frameworks | Immutable, permissionless → *generally exempt* |

## 🧠 6. Terminology and Disclosure
Use of correct language protects the ecosystem and users.

✅ Recommended terminology:
> **Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA)**  
> *A crypto-collateralized digital asset governed solely by immutable smart contracts.*

🚫 Avoid phrases such as “digital dollar,” “payment stablecoin,” or “fiat-pegged coin.”
