# 🧬 pSunDAIvaultV2 — Autonomous Final Form

### Immutable Stable Vault — PulseChain Edition  
by **Elite Team6**

---

## 🔥 Overview

**pSunDAIvaultV2** is an *immutable, autonomous* stablecoin vault built for the **PulseChain** ecosystem.  
It represents the **final-form evolution** of decentralized collateralization — a vault that requires no admin, no governance, and no human maintenance.

Every rule of operation — collateralization, liquidation, safety ratios, cooldowns, and oracle management — is **self-enforced** on-chain, deterministically and transparently.

> “No keys. No upgrades. No rug paths.  
> Only math, code, and immutable logic.”

## ⚙️ Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | All functions are self-regulating. There are no admin modifiers or upgrade hooks. |
| **Immutability** | Once deployed, parameters and logic cannot be changed. Constants are hardcoded at compile time. |
| **Determinism** | Each vault operation yields a predictable, auditable result governed by mathematics — not governance. |
| **Oracle Safety** | Dual-layer oracle system with timestamp enforcement, ±5% clamp, and stale-data fallback. |
| **Collateral Integrity** | PLS and WPLS are handled directly; collateral cannot be rehypothecated or redirected. |
| **Permissionless Operation** | Any address can deposit, mint, repay, withdraw, or liquidate within protocol-defined bounds. |
| **Final Form** | The protocol contains no owner, admin, or upgrade roles. It will operate until the chain itself ends. |

## 💡 Key Features

### 🧱 Vault Mechanics
- **150% Collateral Ratio**
- **110% Liquidation Ratio**
- **Automatic Price Safety Clamp (±5%)**
- **24-hour Oracle Failure Delay**
- **3-hour Auction Time for Liquidations**
- **0.1 PLS Minimum Action Threshold**

### ⚡ User Functions
- `depositPLS()` — Deposit native PLS.
- `deposit()` — Deposit WPLS directly.
- `mint()` — Mint pSunDAI against deposited collateral.
- `repay()` — Burn pSunDAI to repay debt.
- `withdrawPLS()` / `withdraw()` — Withdraw collateral if vault is safe.
- `depositAndAutoMint()` — Deposit PLS and auto-mint pSunDAI at 155% ratio.
- `repayAndWithdraw()` — Close or rebalance a vault in a single transaction.
- `liquidate()` — Permissionless liquidation with capped bonus.
- `emergencyWithdraw()` — Oracle-failure recovery after 24h delay.

### 🧠 Read / UI Functions
- `vaultSummary()` — Returns all core vault metrics (collateral, debt, ratio, max mintable, last price).
- `maxMintable()` — Calculates how much pSunDAI a vault can mint safely.
- `_collateralRatio()` — Internal ratio check for safety.
- `_isSafe()` — Core risk evaluation logic.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

> “Autonomous systems do not need governance;  
> they need invariants that make governance unnecessary.”

The **Elite Protocol** model defines DeFi primitives that can exist without human control:
- **No owner functions**
- **No upgrade proxies**
- **No external governance votes**
- **No mutable parameters**

The system’s behavior is defined by *immutable constants* embedded in bytecode, ensuring that every user interacts under identical, transparent rules for eternity.

## 🧱 System Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `COLLATERAL_RATIO` | 150 | Required collateralization % |
| `LIQUIDATION_RATIO` | 110 | Minimum safety threshold % |
| `MAX_BONUS_CAP` | 200 | 2% liquidation bonus cap |
| `WITHDRAW_COOLDOWN` | 1800 | 30-minute cooldown |
| `AUCTION_TIME` | 10800 | 3-hour liquidation auction window |
| `MIN_ACTION_AMOUNT` | 0.1 PLS | Smallest valid action |
| `ORACLE_FAIL_DELAY` | 24 hours | Delay before emergencyWithdraw |

## 🛡️ Security Design

1. **Oracle Protection**  
   - Rejects stale data (>300s old).  
   - ±5% clamp prevents short-term oracle manipulation.  
   - Safe fallback to `lastSafePrice`.

2. **Reentrancy Protection**  
   - All state-changing functions use `nonReentrant` from OpenZeppelin’s guard.

3. **Collateral Isolation**  
   - Every vault maps collateral and debt to a single user.  
   - No shared pools; no exposure between vaults.

4. **Liquidation Safety**  
   - Time-weighted auctions with bonus caps.  
   - Minimum repay amount ensures fair execution.  
   - Collateral rewards are bounded and deterministic.

5. **Emergency Mode**  
   - Triggers only on oracle failure for 24h+.  
   - Users can withdraw collateral manually.  
   - No owner override — pure autonomy.
